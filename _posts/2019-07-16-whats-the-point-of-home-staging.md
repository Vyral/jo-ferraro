Today I want to talk a little bit about selling your home. This market’s starting to slow down a little bit and become more balanced than it has been in the past. I’ve been getting a lot of questions about staging and the impact that it can have on a home sale, so I wanted to explain it in further detail today.

**Staging is a term that refers to how you prepare your house for the market.** It involves taking professional photographs, doing some odd jobs, decluttering, cleaning, and, of course, staging the home with furniture. Homes that are staged generally net a higher sale price than those that aren’t.

**This process does involve a few considerations, however.** The first is the dollar consideration. Do you have the time and money to invest in staging your home?&nbsp;

I’ve recently contracted with a company that does virtual stagings. I’ve taken vacant listings without furniture and had them really shine online. **Virtual staging is much less expensive than the alternative and so far, our results have been phenomenal.**&nbsp;I've taken vacant homes without furniture and turned them into impressive online listings. We were even able to hire a virtual staging company that helped us get a full-price offer on a vacant home that had trouble selling in the past.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about home staging or about anything else related to real estate, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
