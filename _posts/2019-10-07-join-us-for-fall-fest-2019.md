<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Fall Fest is coming up and you’re invited\! Here are all the details.</em></p>

It’s that time of year again. Leaves are changing color, the weather is getting colder, and our annual Fall Fest is coming up\! We hope you’ll join us on Saturday, October 26 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at 4810 Larson Beach Rd for a great afternoon of autumn fun for the whole family. There will be plenty of food, face painting for the kids, free pumpkins, a photo booth, and much more to enjoy. You won’t want to miss it. Better yet, this event is absolutely free for our past clients. All we ask is that you bring a non-perishable food item along. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
