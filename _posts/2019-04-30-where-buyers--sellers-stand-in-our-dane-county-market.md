What’s the latest news from our Dane County real estate market?

Year to date, our median sale price is up 1.9%, which is great news for sellers. The number of sales, however, has dropped 6.8%, which can partially be explained by the tough winter we had to endure. 

Interest rates are still down, which is good news for buyers. **If you’re thinking of buying this year, the sooner you act, the better**—we’re entering our prime selling season, and a lot of inventory is poised to enter the market. 

If you have any other questions about our market or you’d like to get started on your home buying or selling journey, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you.
