As we approach Thanksgiving, we went around to our team members and asked each of them what they’re thankful for this year. Here’s what they had to say.

We’d like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of you this Thanksgiving. We have met some truly wonderful people, and we’re proud to have helped so many reach their real estate goals over the years. We wouldn’t be where we are today without all of your support.&nbsp; Enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner with all of your family and friends—that’s what we plan to do\! In the meantime, to see what each member of the Ferraro Team is thankful for this year, watch this short video.

In the video above, you can hear from each member of our team about what they are most thankful for this year. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you have any real estate questions between now and the next time we talk. We would be happy to help you.
