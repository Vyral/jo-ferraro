As a buyer in our market, chances are fair that you’ll have to compete in a multiple-offer situation in order to get the home you want. With that in mind, **here are three tips that will help you come out on top if you find yourself facing this scenario.**

First, understand the seller is in the driver’s seat.&nbsp;

Second, remember that price is a high determining factor, but it’s not always the most important one.

Third, check the contingencies and terms in your offer. Sometimes the cleanest offer (i.e., the one with the fewest contingencies the seller has to work through) can win out even if it doesn’t offer the highest price. Also, make sure you have all your ducks in a row in terms of your financing, pre-approval terms, etc. Talk to your agent and find out what the seller is looking for.&nbsp;

As far as this tip goes, one trick that I’ve seen work wonders for buyers is to write a personal letter to the seller. A letter describing what you love about their property and detailing a little about your own family can be the deciding factor.&nbsp;

**You only have one shot to make a great first impression, so let that first impression be your highest and best offer right out of the gate.**
