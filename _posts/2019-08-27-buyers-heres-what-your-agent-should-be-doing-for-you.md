I understand how frustrating our current market can be for buyers—especially first-timers. Today I’ve got some advice that will help assuage some of the stress and frustration you might be feeling.

{% include pullquote.html %}

One of the best things you can do for yourself is to **hire an agent who works to serve your best interests.** They should be a full-time agent who knows your market like the back of their hand, presents you with all your options, and does a thorough market analysis on the home you like before your offer is in.&nbsp;

Moreover, **they should advocate for you during the inspection stage, point you to the right lender, and help you select the loan most tailored to your situation.** &nbsp; &nbsp;
