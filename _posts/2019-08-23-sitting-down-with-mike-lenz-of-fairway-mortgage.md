Today I have the pleasure of interviewing Mike Lenz of Fairway Mortgage to talk a little about the company itself and how the market is affecting mortgages and appraisals.

At Fairway Mortgage, they work exclusively with home mortgages, and they concentrate all of their resources on providing clients with the best home buying experience possible. They’re also renowned for giving back to the community and working with local charities, especially those supporting American veterans.

One of the more noteworthy charities they participate in is the American Warrior Initiative, a yearly benefit that raises money for veterans. At the end of the event, they give away two service dogs to veterans that need them. I’ve gone to this event myself, and it’s an amazing and heartfelt experience.&nbsp;

As far as the market goes, Mike says **interest rates are very low, which means people are able to purchase more home for their money.** They’re also having fewer problems getting buyers approved from a debt-to-income ratio standpoint.&nbsp;

Regarding appraisals, there’s not a lot of inventory out there. The supply of homes has gone up since spring, but it’s still a seller’s market. Some listings are generating multiple offers that eventually go above their asking price, and this can cause problems with appraisals. In situations like these, Mike advises his buyer clients that if their accepted offer goes beyond the asking price by any more than a couple thousand dollars, the home’s appraisal may come up short. He also advises them on what their options are if this does happen.&nbsp;

I’ve worked with Mike for many years, and as a Realtor, I’m very appreciative that he does this. I always advise my clients to work with someone who will be honest with you, have your back, and outline your options up front so you can work through the numbers. In other words, someone who comes from a place of education—not simply to secure a sale.&nbsp;

**In general, Mike says it’s a great time to purchase,** and Fairway Mortgage is one of the few companies around that can do a 30-day closing. This is handy if you’re looking to move into a new home before the holiday season or into a new school district while we’re still in the early part of the school year.&nbsp;
