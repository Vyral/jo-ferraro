<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Are fall and winter good times to buy or sell? Yes, and here’s why.</em></p>

Are the fall and winter good seasons in which to buy or sell a home?

To preface our topic, a quick word on our Wisconsin housing market: Year over year, sales have dropped 3.2%, but the median price has increased by 7.6%. Most of this is due to our low inventory and low mortgage rates.&nbsp;

This news more or less answers the question of whether fall and winter are good times to buy or sell. **The fact that mortgage rates are low is great news for buyers, and low inventory means you’ll have less competition if you listed your home during this time.** On top of that, because low mortgage rates mean more buying power for buyers, demand among them is high.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking of buying or selling this fall or winter, don’t give up hope. If you thought about buying but you’ve already signed a lease, there are plenty of options that make it more advantageous for you to purchase now rather than wait until next spring.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about our market or the advantages of buying or selling now, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
