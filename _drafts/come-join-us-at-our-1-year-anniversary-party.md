Today I have a couple of exciting announcements to share with you. First, you’re invited to our office’s one-year anniversary party on Thursday, June 20, right here at 4810 Larson Beach Road in McFarland. From 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., we’ll have live entertainment and plenty of free food, so we’d love it if you came down and met our team\! Second, we’ve launched a brand-new property search site for homebuyers called soldinmytown.com. It’s slick, easy to use, and ready to help you get started with your home search, so be sure to check it out and send us your feedback. We’d love to hear from you.
